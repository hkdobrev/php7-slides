                    <aside class="notes">
                        Hi!
                        PHP 7 was released around a year ago, but many projects still haven't updated.
                        We've recently went through the update process
                        and I'd like to tell you about what we went through
                        and how you could upgrade your evolving application while in production.

                    <h2>No deadline</h2>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Don't set yourself a deadline.
                        I've set a deadline to upgrade before this talk and it was a mistake.
                        Don't rush it and cover your bases so you don't get bugs on production.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Start early. You can never start too early.
                        There will always be this one library which doesn't support
                        PHP 7, but you can't really remove it easily and would be a PITA.
                        Stop finding excuses not to upgrade. Start now.

                            So how do we actually do it?
                            Start with your development environment.
                            Install PHP 7 and start checking things off like:
                            PHP extensions, Composer dependencies and
                            major broken things until your application works.
                            Chances are you would be able to make most
                            features run on PHP 7 in just a few hours.

                        <h2>Upgrade shared environment</h2>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            No matter if you use Vagrant, Docker or whatever
                            upgrade it to PHP 7 as early as possible.
                            Make sure all of your developers are building new features
                            and testing the application on PHP 7.

                            The testing environment - the most important one.
                            First make sure your tests pass on PHP 7 and fix any errors.
                            This is one of the moments where your testsuite really matters.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            You can use continuous integration to run your tests
                            both on PHP 5 and PHP 7.
                            Even though you still have PHP 5 on production,
                            you can continue developing your application with
                            PHP 7 in mind and fix any issues.

                            Test your dependencies on PHP 7 as well.
                            This is something which many people would skip,
                            but it's really important.
                            Even if the tests of your application pass
                            you can't cover everything and you must ensure
                            all the unit tests of your dependencies pass on PHP 7 as well.
                            What we did is we got a list of all of our top-level dependencies
                            and started checking them off.
                            We checked if it was tested on PHP 7, whether we needed to upgrade
                            to a newer version, we've made some pull requests to projects
                            and also we've gone through all of our own packages
                            and updated tests.

                            Go over the breaking changes.
                            Aside from the automatic approach with tests,
                            this is about a more human approach.
                            Read the list of PHP 7 breaking changes and go through your codebase.
                            Some of the potential pitfalls could be found with searching
                            for specific syntax, others could be found with common-sense
                            and the insight you have of your own app.

                            There's a PHP 7 compatibility checker.
                            This is an interesting project which you may find very useful
                            to find any other potential problems.
                            It performs a static code analysis on your codebase
                            and shows you the exact spots of your code which
                            wouldn't or might not work on PHP 7.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            So there are these three approaches:

                                <li>Static code analysis</li>
                            </ul>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Once you are comfortable with your app on PHP 7,
                        upgrade your staging server if you have one
                        and observe if there are any problems while your
                        colleagues, clients or beta testers use it.

                            So we come to the real test - the production environment.
                            If you have been meticulous this would be easy.
                            But if you want to be better safe than sorry, then
                            don't just upgrade your production servers to PHP 7
                            and hope for the best.

                            You can use a load balancer in front of you application servers
                            and create new servers on PHP 7.
                            You can gradually put traffic on them and check if anything's amiss.
                            When everything is OK, remove your PHP 5 servers.

                        but also start using the new features like scalar and return
                        type declarations, new operators, anonymous classes and more.
                        Upgrade the minimum PHP version of your libraries
                        and push the PHP community forward.
